==================
Worked on static UML class diagragm.
Got test driven development model working for Python, Java, and Perl.

Detailed work:
  * Moved more functions into rotations, boosts, and menu classes.
  * Added Layout.Size Class.  Wrote in Java/Python/Perl test and classes.
  * Added task makeJavaShells.  Need to add a new key/value pair for each runnable java class.
  * Added Layout.Grid class.
  * Builds another java executable.
  * Using variable names_with_underscores instead of mixedCaseNames.
  * Added  appLength, appWidth to Layout class.
  * Lots of work on the Layout subclasses.
  * Changed #! line to use env, more general.
  * Use main() instead of run(), more traditional name.
  * Using setUp in test classes.
